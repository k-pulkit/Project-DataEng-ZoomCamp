# Project-DataEng-ZoomCamp
This repository contains the implementation of project that I created as part of the free data engineering course called "data-engineering-zoomcamp". 
This is a very practical project based learning program that has given me the confidence and knowledge to practice data engineering in GCP.

## Some of the key technologies that I am going to use in this project are as follows:
1. GCP - Data lake and DataWarehouse, i.e. GCS and BigQuery
2. Orchestration - Airflow
3. Containerization - Docker, Docker-compose
4. Batch processing - Spark
5. Transformation - dbt
6. Streaming - Kafka
7. Other - Terraform for IaC

I will keep updating this document as I progress in the course.
